## Configuration Notes

The performance optimizer can be configured through environment variables:

- `OPTIMIZATION_LEVEL`: basic, moderate, aggressive
- `CACHE_STRATEGY`: memory, disk, hybrid
- `OPTIMIZATION_MAX_WORKERS`: Number of parallel workers
- `OPTIMIZATION_PARALLEL`: Enable/disable parallel processing
- `CACHE_SIZE`: Maximum cache size
- `DISK_CACHE_PATH`: Disk cache directory
- `REQUEST_THROTTLING`: Enable request throttling
- `BATCH_PROCESSING`: Enable batch processing
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Batch size for processing

## Next Steps

1. **Test the implementation**: Run the test script to verify functionality
2. **Integrate with existing components**: Update other modules to use the PerformanceOptimizer
3. **Add to CLI commands**: Include optimization options in the CLI
4. **Create documentation**: Add usage examples to the main documentation
5. **Benchmark performance**: Measure the actual performance improvements
