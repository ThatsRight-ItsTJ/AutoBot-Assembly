You can modify the `news_sources` list in `main.py` to add your own news websites:

self.news_sources = [
    {
        'name': 'Your News Site',
        'url': 'https://your-news-site.com',
        'headline_selector': '.headline-class'
    }
]
```

## Output Format

The scraper saves headlines in the following JSON format:

```json
{
    "timestamp": "2023-XX-XXTXX:XX:XX",
    "sources": [
        {
            "name": "News Source Name",
            "url": "https://source-url.com",
            "headlines_count": 10,
            "headlines": ["Headline 1", "Headline 2", ...]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Notes

- Replace the example URLs with real news websites
- Respect robots.txt and terms of service of target websites
- Consider adding rate limiting for production use
